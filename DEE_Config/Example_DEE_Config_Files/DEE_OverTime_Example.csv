Stage,Tools Needed,Rationale
RFI,"Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint","Early response stage primarily involves reusing past analysis and creating quick graphics in PowerPoint."
RFP,"MS-Word, MS-PowerPoint, MS-Project","Widely used for building detailed RFP content (Word), creating stakeholder briefings (PowerPoint), and basic project planning (MS Project)."
Proposal,"MS-Word, MS-PowerPoint, MS-Project, MS-Excel, Cameo (Requirements & Architecture Tools), Low-Fidelity Analysis Tools","Proposal creation benefits from a suite of Office tools plus Cameo for capturing system requirements/architectures and low-fidelity modeling for preliminary performance/cost analysis."
ASR,"Matlab, Cameo, MS-Project, MS-Excel","At the Alternative System Review, we refine architecture and evaluate performance trade-offs with Matlab. Cameo supports MBSE, MS-Project manages schedules, and Excel handles data organization and cost/schedule analysis."
SRR,"Matlab, Cameo, Siemens Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","System Requirements Review verifies final requirements and architecture using Cameo, manages product data in Teamcenter, and uses Matlab for analyses. MS-Project handles scheduling, Excel tracks cost/budget data."
SFR,"Matlab, Cameo, Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","System Functional Review stage refines the functional baseline, uses Cameo for system modeling, Teamcenter for configuration control, Matlab for subsystem analysis, Project for timeline, Excel for cost tracking."
PDR,"Ansys HFSS, Autodesk Eagle, Siemens Star-CCM+, Ansys Mechanical, AFSIM Mission Effects Model, Siemens NX, Dassault Delmia, Cameo, Siemens Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","Preliminary Design Review focuses on higher-fidelity simulations (EM, fluid, structural), mission effects analysis, mechanical design in NX, manufacturing planning in Delmia, configuration in Teamcenter, scheduling in Project, cost in Excel, and system architecture in Cameo."
CDR,"Ansys HFSS, Autodesk Eagle, Siemens Star-CCM+, Ansys Mechanical, AFSIM Mission Effects Model, Siemens NX, Dassault Delmia, Cameo, Siemens Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","Critical Design Review validates final design details, verifying electromagnetic, thermal, structural, and mission performance. NX and Delmia handle mechanical/manufacturing, Teamcenter tracks configurations, Cameo ensures system consistency, and Office tools manage schedules/cost."
MFR,"Matlab, Ansys HFSS, Autodesk Eagle, Siemens Star-CCM+, Ansys Mechanical, AFSIM Mission Effects Model, Siemens NX, Dassault Delmia, Cameo, Siemens Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","Manufacturing Feasibility Review ensures the design is optimized for production. Matlab, HFSS, etc. confirm performance and manufacturability, NX/Delmia finalize manufacturing processes, Cameo tracks system updates, Teamcenter manages versions, and MS-Project/Excel handle schedule and cost."
TRR,"Matlab, Cameo, HPC Simulation Tools (e.g. Ansys), Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","Test Readiness Review confirms the system test approach, uses Matlab for test data simulation, HPC tools for specialized analysis, Cameo for requirement trace, Teamcenter for updated part definitions, Project for timeline, and Excel for cost management."
SVR,"Matlab, Ansys HFSS, Autodesk Eagle, Siemens Star-CCM+, Ansys Mechanical, AFSIM Mission Effects Model, Siemens NX, Dassault Delmia, Cameo, Siemens Teamcenter, MS-Project, MS-Excel","System Verification Review checks final integration and validation tests, ensuring readiness for deployment. Matlab and HPC tools handle final analyses, cameo documents requirement closure, Teamcenter manages final configuration, Project and Excel track schedules and costs."
